//the ICANON flag is a local flag used to turn off canonical mode; we can finally read input byte-by-byte rather than line-by-line
//the ISIG flag is a local flag used to turn off commands like Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z which terminate and suspend running program respectively(also turns off Ctrl+Y command for MacOS which is similar to Ctrl+Z but waits for program to read input before suspending it)
